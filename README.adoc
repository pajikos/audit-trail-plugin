This plugin keeps a log of who performed particular Jenkins operations, such as configuring jobs.

This plugin adds an _Audit Trail_ section in the main Jenkins
configuration page.
On this page, you can configure log destination and settings
(eg file size and number of rotating log files), and a URI pattern for
requests to be logged.
The default options select most actions with
significant effect such as creating/configuring/deleting jobs and views
or delete/save-forever/start a build.
The log is written to disk as
configured and recent entries can also be viewed in the Manage / System
Log section.

Also see the
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JobConfigHistory+Plugin[JobConfigHistory
Plugin] for recording actual changes made to job configurations.

The file logger relies on `java.util.logging.FileHandler` and can use
patterns to describe the log file location as documented
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/FileHandler.html[here]
(`+%h+`, `+%g+`...).

=== Syslog logger

Send audit logs to a Syslog server.
