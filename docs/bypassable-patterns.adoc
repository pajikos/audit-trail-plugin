== Bypassable Patterns

Historically this plugin proposed a default pattern that could be bypassed by an attacker to avoid having a request logged.
For instance the plugin was logging by default a request to `/configSubmit` but not to `/configSubmit/forged`.
The issue is that Jenkins will internally route both requests the same way, so an attacker could submit a configuration change without it being logged.

NOTE: we are here only talking about the logging of the requests, this is in no way a bypass of Jenkins security mechanism.
The attacker would still have needed ADMINISTRATIVE rights to submit the configuration.

The default pattern has been changed to mitigate this attack.
In addition, all instances using one of the known legacy default pattern get their pattern automatically updated to the safe default.

In addition, an administrative monitor detects common keywords that users might try to catch, and notifies them if their custom pattern suffers this flaw.
